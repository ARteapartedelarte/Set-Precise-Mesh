# Set Presice Mesh Add-on

Right now “Set Precise Mesh” allows users to set exact values of the angle between three vertexes and also sets the exact length of the edge and has extra features for it.

You can set exact value of the angle between three vertexes. 

To change the angle it is necessary to select three vertices. The last selected vertex will be active and will affect on the angle change, i.e. active vertex will be moved.

If you enable "Change adjacent edge", the edge adjacent to the angle will be changed, otherwise the edge opposite to the angle will be changed.

To change the angle script uses a normal based on the three selected vertexes:

</a>

To change the length of the edge it is necessary to select two verteces. The last selected vertex (active vertex) will change its length, i.e. last selected vertex will be moved.

If you enable "Change two directions" the length will change based on the two selected vertexes i.e. two selceted vertexes will be moved.
